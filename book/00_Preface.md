The Distributed Guide is a map of the world of distributed computation. 
The goal is to be the guide that I personally wish existed when I first
started my journey of learning. The guide not only introduces concepts but
helps link them to related ideas as well as give you a map of where each
individual piece fits in and gives a view in how these algorithms and
ideas work together.

## Who this guide is for

This guide is intended for developers with an understanding of the basics and
whom are comfortable working in a single-application environment who are
interested in the mechanics and workings of distributed computing. A guide
such as this is not required to effectively use distributed applications
(such as a distributed database). However if your wish is to develop your
own distributed system (such as a database), then this is a good starting
point to understand what is required of you.

## How to read this guide

The guide is broken into chapters that can generally be read serially. Each chapter
is broken down into 3 parts: **prerequisites**, **topic information**, and
**further reading**. 

The **prerequisites** section will let you know what
concepts, if any, the algorithm builds upon. This section will contain links
to other portion of the guide that should be read before, or alongside, the
current chapter.

The **topic information** section is the bulk of the chapter and contains
mostly what you would expect. This portion of the chapter may be further broken
down and may even have it's own table of contents. 

The **further reading** section contains two possible bits of information. The
first is a list of topics that build upon the current chapter (i.e. chapters in
which the pre-requisites include the _current_ chapter). The second bit of
information may include related links such as YouTube videos, research papers,
open source projects, etc.
