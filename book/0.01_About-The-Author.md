<div class="chapter-title">About The Author</div>

Hello! My name is John Murray. I am a software developer programming in PHP, Java,
Python, Ruby, Scala, Go, and whatever else is required / useful / interesting. I've
always found distributed computing and distributed algorithms interesting, but have
never been able to find super-great resources to learn from. This guide represents a
repository of knowledge that I am collecting over time as well as a resource for others
to learn from.

You can find me on the usual channels.
