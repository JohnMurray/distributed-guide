  <h1>A Guide Book for Distributed Computation</h1>
  <p>
    Distributed computation (programming) can be a difficult and nebulous
    topic to learn.

    This book introduces concepts in distributed computing as well as foundational
    topics and resources for further learning. This is the result of self-teachings
    and content, as it stands today, is very much a work-in-progress.

    <a href="/book">Read online for free</a> and eventually I'll get
    some e-book versions up here.

  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

  <h4>Why?</h4>
  <p>
    I've long had an interest in distributed computing, but it can be hard to know
    where to look and what to read to really get started. I've recently told myself
    that I'm going to get more serious about learning this topic and I wanted to put
    together a guide based on what I learn (starting from nothing, more or less). This
    guide is intended to be what I wish existed right when I started, so future folks can
    benifit. It's also a way to help me memorize these concepts and shamelessly promote
    myself.
  </p>

  <h4>How soon can I get an e-book version?</h4>
  <p>
    The guide is still very much in the early stages and, given that, there is just a lot
    up in there air in terms of content, layout, organization, etc. After I collect 
    more information and nail down the particulars, then I'll look at generating and
    distributing e-book versions.
  </p>

  <h4>Did anyone actually ask these questions?</h4>
  <p>Nope. I just wanted my site to look popular.</p>
