# Distributed Guide

This is a guide that I am building (likely for quite some time) while I go down
the deep, deep rabbit hole that is distributed computation. This guide is still
very much a work in progress and has no viewable form beyond the code in this
repository. Please check back soon for something easily viewable.

## Building

The application can be build using the Makefile (not really, but soon!) and you will
most certainly need to have [`pandoc`][1] installed.
